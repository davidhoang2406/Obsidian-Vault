Pointers are a fundamental concept in Go that allow you to work with memory addresses directly.

Here's a comprehensive explanation:

1. **Basic Pointer Concept**

```go
var x int = 42  
var p *int = &x  // p is a pointer to x
```

- The `&` operator gets the memory address of a variable
- The `*` symbol in the declaration means "pointer to"
- `*int` means "pointer to an integer"

2. **Dereferencing Pointers**

```go
var x int = 42  
var p *int = &x  
fmt.Println(*p)  // prints 42 - dereferencing the pointer
*p = 21          // change the value through the pointer
fmt.Println(x)   // prints 21
```

- The `*` operator when used before a pointer variable dereferences it
- Dereferencing gives you access to the value at that memory address

3. **Zero Value of Pointers**

```go
var p *int  // p is nil by defaultif p == nil {  
    fmt.Println("p is nil")  
}
```

- The zero value of a pointer is `nil`
- Dereferencing a nil pointer causes a panic

4. **Pointers with Functions**

```go
func modifyValue(x *int) {  
    *x = *x * 2  
}  
  
num := 10  
modifyValue(&num)  
fmt.Println(num)  // prints 20
```

- Passing pointers allows functions to modify the original value
- This is useful when you want to avoid copying large data structures

5. **Pointers to Structs**

```go
type Person struct {  
    Name string  
    Age  int  
}  
p := &Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 25}  
fmt.Println(p.Name)  // Go automatically dereferences - no need for (*p).Name
```

- Go provides syntactic sugar for accessing struct fields through pointers
- `p.Name` is equivalent to `(*p).Name`

In your blockchain code example, pointers are used in several places:

1. In the struct methods: `Block`

```go
func (b *Block) SetHash() {  
    // Using pointer receiver allows modifying the original Block}
```

2. In the function: `NewBlock`

```go
func NewBlock(data string, prevBlockHash []byte) *Block {  
    // Returns a pointer to a new Block}
```

3. In the struct: `Blockchain`

```go
type Blockchain struct {  
    Blocks []*Block  // Slice of pointers to Block}

```

Common use cases for pointers:

1. When you need to modify a variable in a function
2. To avoid copying large data structures
3. When implementing methods that need to modify the receiver
4. When dealing with optional values (using `nil`)

Best practices:

1. Use pointers for large structs to avoid copying
2. Use pointers when you need to modify the original value
3. Use value types for small structs that don't need modification
4. Always check for nil when working with pointers that might be null
5. Be careful with pointer arithmetic (Go doesn't support it directly)

Remember:

- Pointers help with memory efficiency
- They can make code more complex, so use them judiciously
- Go's garbage collector handles memory management
- Unlike C, Go doesn't support pointer arithmetic
- The `new()` function can be used to create pointers to zero-valued variables
